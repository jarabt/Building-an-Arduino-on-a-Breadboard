# Building-an-Arduino-on-a-Breadboard

Basic Parts for wiring up Arduino (5V) 

    Breadboard (around 800 points which is double size of the one from Arduino Starter Kit) 
    22 AWG wire (American wire gauge (AWG), standardized wire gauge system for the diameters of round, solid, nonferrous, electrically conducting wire (from the Arduino Starter Kit hope will be OK)). This one should be with diameter 0.644 mm.
    7805 Voltage regulator. A mechanism to provide a consistent 5V Supply. http://www.ezk.cz/stabilizatory_reference.htm
    2 LEDs (from Arduino Starter Kit) 
    2 220 Ohm resistors (from Arduino Starter Kit) 
    1 10k Ohm resistor (from Arduino Starter Kit) 
    2 10 uF capacitors (not from ASK - there are only 100 uF) http://www.ezk.cz/kondenzatory_elektrolyticke_radialni_elrs.htm
    16 MHz clock crystal
    2 22 pF capacitors http://www.ezk.cz/kondenzatory_keramicke.htm
    small momentary normally open ("off") button, i.e. Omron type B3F (from Arduino Starter Kit) 
    
USB to Serial Communication Board
